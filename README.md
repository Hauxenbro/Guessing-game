Guessing Game on Python

I made a little guessing game on python. 
I used tkinter, sys and random classical libraries.

main.py - answers for UI at the APP and start Application
functionals.py - answers for functionality of buttons and getting user datas from the entries
game_conf.py - configures work with collected user datas, answers for gaming process.
